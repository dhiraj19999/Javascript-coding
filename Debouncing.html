/*

Debouncing is a programming pattern or a technique to restrict the calling of a time-consuming function 
frequently, by delaying the execution of the function until a specified time to avoid unnecessary CPU cycles,
 and API calls and improve performance


 The debounce() function forces a function to wait a certain amount of time before running again. 
 The function is built to limit the number of times a function is called.
