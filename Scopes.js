// WHAT IS SCOPES //

//Scope. An important idea in programming is scope. Scope defines where 
//variables can be accessed or referenced. While some variables 
//can be accessed from anywhere within a program, other variables may onâ€¦ 
//Blocks and Scope.
//In JavaScript, objects and functions are also variables.
// Scope determines the accessibility of variables, objects,
// and functions from different parts of the code.



// What is the execution context & stack in JavaScript?//

//The Execution Context is an abstract environment created by JS to execute code.
// The Execution Stack is used to execute functions and keep track of all the 
//Execution Context created. The Execution context is created in two stages, 
//the creation and the execution stage

//he Execution Context contains the code that's currently running, and everything 
//that aids in its execution. During the Execution Context run-time, the specific 
//code gets parsed by a parser, the variables and functions are stored in memory, 
//executable byte-code gets generated, and the code gets executed.







// GLOBAL SCOPE//

//In a programming environment, the global scope is the scope that contains, 
//and is visible in, all other scopes. In client-side JavaScript, 
//the global scope is generally the web page inside which all the code is 
//being executed.
//Global variables can be accessed and modified anywhere in the program
