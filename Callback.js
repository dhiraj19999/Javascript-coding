//  WHAT IS CALLBACK FUNCTION // 

//  A callback is a function that is executed after another function has finished executing. 
//As we have studied earlier that functions are objects. Functions can take functions as 
//arguments and can be returned by other functions. Functions that take another function as an 
//argument are called higher-order functions. So, the callback function can also be defined as 
//any function that is passed as an argument is called a callback function. //


//  Why do we need Callbacks?//


//As we know, instead of waiting for a response, JavaScript will keep executing while listening
// for other events. Here is an example:

function fun1(){
    console.log("code with harry");
 }
function fun2(){
   console.log("javascript");
 }
//fun1();
//fun2();

//The function fun1 is executed first, and the function fun2 is executed second. 
//JavaScript runs code from top to bottom. However, there are some cases that code must run 
//after something else happens and also not using a top-down approach.

//Callbacks are used to make sure that a function is not going to execute before a task is 
//completed but will execute right after the task has completed. It helps us develop 
//asynchronous JavaScript code and keeps us safe from future errors.

//In JavaScript, the way to create a callback function is to pass it as a parameter to another 
///function, and then to call it back right after something has happened or some task is
// completed.


// Example of call back function//  

function addition(x, y , callback){
setTimeout(() => {
document.write(`The sum of ${x} and ${y} is ${x+y}.`); 
callback(); 
 }, 5000); } 
 // display() function is called just after the ending of addition() function
function display(){ 
document.write('Numbers added!'); 
 } 
 // Calling addition() function
addition(5,5,display);



//Here are the two functions â€“ addition(x, y, callback) and display().
// Here addition() is called after 5 seconds with the display() function, 
//i.e. passed in as the third argument to the addition function along with two numbers x and y.
// As a result, the addition() is invoked with 1, 2 and the display() which is the callback. 
//The addition() prints the addition of the two numbers(x+y), and as soon as that is done, 
//the callback function is executed.
