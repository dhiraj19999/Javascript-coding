CSS variables are custom properties in which you can store a value and use it anywhere in the HTML code

<body>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="box"></div>
        <div class="box"></div>
        <div class="box"></div>
    </div>
</body>

.box{
            --box-color: violet;
            width:200px;
            height: 200px;
            background-color: var(--box-color);
            border: 2px solid var(--box-color);
            box-shadow: 3px 3px var(--box-color);
            margin: 2px 9px;
        }
        :root{
            --primary-color: blue;
            --danger-color: red;
            --maxw: 333px;
        }

        Any custom properties written in the root variable can be accessed anywhere in the code.





        postion:


        position: absolute;
An element with the absolute position will move according to the position of its parent element.
In the absence of any parent element, the HTML element will be placed relative to the page.

position: static;
It is the default position of HTML elements.
position: relative;
It is used when we need to position an HTML element relative to its normal position.
We can set the top, right, bottom, and left properties that will cause the element to adjust away from 
the normal position.


position: fixed;
An element with position:fixed; will remain stuck to a specific position even after the page is scrolled.
This position property is used when we want to keep an HTML element at a fixed spot no matter where 
on the page the user is.


position: sticky;
It is a hybrid of relative and fixed position.
An HTML element with position:sticky; will just sit there until a given position offset is met.




BOX model :
In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.

The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins,
 borders, padding, and the actual content. The image below illustrates the box model:


Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent
