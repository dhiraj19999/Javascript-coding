// DIFFERNCE BET UNDEFINED AND NULL?

//undefined is a variable that refers to something that doesn't exist, and the
// variable isn't defined to be anything. null is a variable that is defined but 
//is missing a value.

//The undefined value is a primitive value used when a variable has not been 
//assigned a value. The null value is a primitive value that represents the null,
// empty, or non-existent reference



//WHAT DOES && OPRETOR DO//

//The logical AND operator ( && ) returns true if both operands are true and 
//returns false otherwise




//WHAT DOES || OPRETOR DO//

//The logical OR operator ( || ) returns the boolean value true if either or 
//both operands is true and returns false otherwise


//Is using unary operator is fastest way to convert string to number?

/// The unary plus ( + ) operator is the fastest (and preferred) method of 
//converting something into a number. It can convert: string representations of 
//integers (decimal or hexadecimal) and floats.
//because it does not perform any other operations on the number.




//What is the DOM and why is it used?


//The DOM (Document Object Model) is an interface that represents how your 
//HTML and XML documents are read by the browser. It allows a 
//language (JavaScript) to manipulate, structure, and style your website.
//The DOM defines a standard for accessing documents: "The W3C Document 
//Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that 
//allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, 
//structure, and style of a document."
