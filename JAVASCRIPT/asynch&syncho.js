what is synchronous programming
line by line execution of code

Js can do only one task at a time.

non-blocking behavior is called asynchronous



We want Js to carry on without waiting for a code to get executed

Js is single-threaded so we need a partner, browser.




setTimeout, clearTimeout, edge cases
We will be talking about new functions in Js like setTimeout, setInterval which allows us to execute code 
after a particular duration of time.

setTimeout( function(){
    ...
}, 1000)
// the second argument is the time in ms after which,
// the function in the first argument gets executed 


setInterval( function(){
    ...
}, 1000)
// the second argument is the time period in ms which,
// the function in the first argument gets executed repeatedly


timeoutVar =setTimeout( function(){
    ...
}, 1000)

intVar =setInterval( function(){
    ...
}, 1000)

clearTimeout(timeoutVar)
// Clear the timout. or stops the setTimeout from executing
clearInterval(intVar)
// Clear the interval. or stops the setInterval from executing

How Js keeps track of what to run when?

Call Stack
When you call a function in JavaScript all the instructions within that function get loaded into a Stack.

Javascript then executes the instructions in each function by popping them from the stack.

Callback queue
Itâ€™s a one more data structure that Js to add next code to execute.

Such code are called tasks, since they need more time to execute.

Tasks are added to the queue whenever Js finds a function which will take some time to execute like setTimeout.

Event loop
Event loop runs a loop to keep on checking if anything is remaining in callback queue.

If function calls are still there, they are sent to call stack where they will be executed.

console.log(1); //stack

console.log(2); //stack

setTimeout(function () {
  console.log(3);
}, 3000); //queue

console.log(4); //stack

//js looks for more code
//stack is empty, no more code!
//it will go to queue, will start lookign for code to execute
//it will add to stack

// WHAT IS ASYNCHRONUS PROGRAMING//

//Also known as nonblocking code, asynchronous programming provides opportunities 
//for a program to continue running other code while waiting for a long-running 
//task to complete. The time-consuming task is executed in the background while 
//the rest of the code continues to execute.

//async always returns promise//

// EXAMPLE OF ASYNCHRONUS//
//Data may take long a long time to submit to a database. With asynchronous
// programming, the user can move to another screen while the function continues 
//to execute. When a photo is loaded and sent on Instagram, the user does not have
// to stay on the same screen waiting for the photo to finish loading




// DIFFERNCE BET ASYCH AND SYNCHO//


//The differences between asynchronous and synchronous include: Async is 
//multi-thread, which means operations or programs can run in parallel. Sync is 
//single-thread, so only one operation or program will run at a time. Async is 
//non-blocking, which means it will send multiple requests to a server





// The Async Keyword:-
//We use the async keyword with a function to represent that the function is asynchronous. 
//The async function always returns a promise.

//Here is the syntax of async function is:

async function name(param1, param2, ...paramN) {
    // statements
}



//The await keyword:-
//The await keyword is used to wait for the asynchronous operation. 
//This keyword is used inside the async function. Here is the syntax to use await
// is:

let result = await promise;
//The await pauses the async function until the promise returns a result value. 


//When we want to call this function, we prepend await, and the calling code will

// stop until the promise is resolved or rejected. Here is another example:



//Benefits of using an async function:-
//Debugging using promises sometimes is very hard because the debugger will not 

//step over the asynchronous code. But the Async/await makes this very easy 
//because it is just like synchronous code to the compiler.
//As we can see from the example above, the code looks very simple compared to 
//the code using plain promises, with chaining and callback functions.
//Error handling is simpler in async functions.
// 


//An async function is a function that is declared with the asynckeyword. 
//Async functions are the instances of AsyncFunction constructor, 
//and the await keyword is permitted within them.
//The async and await keywords enable the asynchronous, promise-based behavior 
//to be written cleaner.
 



console.log("This is tutorial 43");

async function harry(){
    console.log('Inside harry function');
    const response = await fetch('https://api.github.com/users');
    console.log('before response');
    const users = await response.json();
    console.log('users resolved')
    return users;

    // return "harry";
}

console.log("Before calling harry")
let a = harry();
console.log("After calling harry")
console.log(a);
a.then(data => console.log(data))
console.log("Last line of this js file")


// Browser provides some funcanality to js//
//  WHENEVER JS ENGINE ENCOUNTERS A PIECE OF CODE THAT WILL TAKE A LONG TIME 
// TO EXCUTE, IT HAND OVER IT'S EXCUATION TO BROWSER,  BROWSER NoW TAKE CARE OF
/// THAT TASK AND WHEN IT GET FINISHED, IT PINGS THE JS ENGIENE, THAT THE TASK IS
// DONE that's how js  engiene and browser work together to make js capble of 
// asynchronus programing


//Message Queue// 

//It's a one more data structure that Js to add next code to execute. 
//Such code are called tasks, since they need more time to execute. 
//Tasks are added to the queue whenever Js finds a function which will 
//take some time to execute.

//JavaScript runs a loop that looks for new messages/tasks on the message queue 
//and pushes them onto the call stack to be executed. that is event loop

//However, the event loop gives priority to the code currently on the call stack. 
//It pushes a new message from the Queue onto the stack after all the code in the 
//stack have been executed and the call stack is empty.
//Queue holds all the code that will require a longer time to excute
// Especially, network requests.
