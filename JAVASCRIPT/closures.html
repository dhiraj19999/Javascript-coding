/*

what is clousers?

A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references
 to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you 
 access to an outer function's scope from an inner function.

 What is meant by lexical scope?
Lexical scope means that in a nested group of functions, the inner 
functions have access to the variables and other resources of their 
parent scope. This means that the child's functions are lexically 
bound to the execution context of their parents. Lexical scope is sometimes also referred 
to as static scope.
