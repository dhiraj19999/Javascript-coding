/*



Variables donâ€™t have values, variables point to values



Primitive Data Types in Js
String
Number
Boolean
Undefined
Null
 Non-Primitive Data Types in Js
Objects
Array
Functions
Main difference between Primitive and Non-primitive:
Primitive data types hold the actual value of a variable. Non-primitive data types hold the memory 
location/address of the value of a variable.
Primitive value cannot be changed (Immutable), Non-primitive data type value can be changed.
Primitive data types are stored by value and Non-primitive data types are stored by reference.



let x="raju"

x[0]='k
x="kaju"  // its not changing the value its reassign the value
console.log(x)== raju  primitive is imutable

primitive hold the actual value.(in js its 
called as by value)

let arr=[1,2,3,4]
arr[0]=2
console.log(arr)==> [2,2,3,4]  non-primitve is mutuble

non primitive hold the location  of value.(in js its 
called as by refernce)
